# Call_Centre_Simulation_Model
We model a hypothetical large-scale international company with presence in multiple countries.
This fictitious enterprise provides worldwide customer service assistance. 
Their call centers are spread around the globe assisting customers from different regions and in multiple languages. 
Every call flows through one or many call centers routing inbound calls towards the most suitable free agent to attend the request with the aim of providing the customer with the best service value. The flow of the incoming calls is modelled and represented as the target business process that we aim to monitor, analyze and improve.

The simulation model is used to evaluate a methodology proposed in [1] to leverage Big Data to support Business Process Improvement, using near real-time process analytics in a decision-support environment.
The simulation was developed using DESMO-J, which is a java-based simulation library that supports both event-oriented and process-oriented modelling approaches.
