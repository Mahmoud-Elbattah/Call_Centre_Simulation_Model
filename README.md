# Summary
<p align="justify">
The repository contains a simulation model used to evaluate a methodology proposed to leverage Big Data to support Business Process Improvement based on near real-time process analytics in a decision-support environment. Using the discrete event simulation approach, the simulation represented a hypothetical call centre distributed in multiple countries. The flow of the incoming calls is modelled and represented as the target business process that we aim to monitor, analyze and improve.
The simulation was developed using the DESMO-J library, which is a java-based simulation library that supports both event-oriented and process-oriented modelling approaches. More details can be found in our publication (Vera-Baquero, Colomo-Palacios, Molloy, and Elbattah, 2015).
