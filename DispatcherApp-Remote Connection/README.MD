The task of the “Dispatcher” application was to transmit the events generated from the simulation model to the analytics framework. Java Message Service (JMS) was adopted as the communication protocol. JMS provides two types of messaging models, publish-and-subscribe and point-to-point queuing. The dispatcher used the P2P model, where the message can be consumed only once from the queue.  
The transmitted messages had to comply with exBPAF format, which can be accepted by the analytics framework. Additionally, the dispatcher included the capability to control the timing of the transmitted messages, which can be used to measure the capacity of the framework. The figure below depicts the main components of the simulation ecosystem where the simulation model, dispatcher and analytics framework collaborate.
